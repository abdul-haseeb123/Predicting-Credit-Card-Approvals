# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
âœ¨ Predicting Credit Card Approval using Python

# Credit Card Approval Predictor

This project aims to automate the credit card approval process using machine learning techniques. By building a predictive model, we can save time and effort typically spent on manually analyzing credit card applications. The model will assess various factors such as loan balances, income levels, and credit report inquiries to determine the likelihood of approval.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Due to confidentiality, the contributor has anonymized the feature names. The dataset contains a combination of numerical and non-numerical features, with values spanning different ranges. Additionally, there are missing entries that need to be addressed during preprocessing.

## Project Structure

1. **Loading and Viewing the Dataset**: In this section, we load the dataset and examine its structure. We will gain insights into the feature types, value ranges, and identify missing data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing is crucial to ensure the dataset is suitable for training a machine learning model. This section will cover handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary data transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA helps us understand the dataset better and build intuitions about the relationships between different features. We will visualize and analyze the data to gain insights that can guide our model selection and feature engineering.

4. **Machine Learning Model Building**: In this final section, we will develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of credit card approval based on the available features. We will train and evaluate various models, fine-tuning their parameters to achieve the best performance.
